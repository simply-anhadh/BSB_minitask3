ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset introduced by Ronald Fisher.
It consists of 150 flower samples across three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) with four features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations & Insights
1. Scatter Plot â€“ Petal Length vs Petal Width

Shows strong separation of Setosa from other species.

Versicolor and Virginica overlap but differ in ranges.

2. Boxplots â€“ Sepal & Petal Features

Petal length and width clearly differentiate species.

Sepal width overlaps across species, making it less discriminative.

3. Violin Plot â€“ Petal Length Distribution

Distinct clusters: Setosa (small), Versicolor (medium), Virginica (large).

4. Pairwise Scatter Matrix

Petal length & width are strongly correlated.

Sepal measurements alone are weaker indicators.

ðŸš€ How to Run

Clone this repository or download the files.

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas matplotlib scipy seaborn


Run the script:

python iris_analysis_fixed.py


Check the output plots in the project folder.

ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaways

Petal features are the best predictors of species.

Sepal features show more overlap, offering less separation.

Strong correlation between petal length & width aids classification.
